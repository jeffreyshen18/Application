# Application

**Work / Project Examples**

  During my previous internship, I was tasked with developing client side and server side components for a business intelligence tool called Deep Sea. Interns were initially split into teams and worked together on weekly sprints but eventually we were tasked with completing independent components. 
  
  The first major component I was assigned to work on was called the card studio page. This component would allow the admin to customize the type of cards that the insight engine would show to its clients. Each card could contain KPIs, charts and tables with data retrieved from MongoDB or Google Big Query. The page would contain functionality to search, insert, edit and delete cards to the database. I worked with JavaScript and React as a framework to build the client facing components and I used Redux to maintain state. On the server side, I wrote GET, PUT, POST and DELETE requests to retrieve and modify data stored in MongoDB or Google BigQuery. 
  
  The most challenging aspect of the internship was when I was tasked with developing the admin control panel. As the primary developer for this page, I was responsible for building out both the server side and client side components. On the client side, the control panel had to contain a table for user access logs, a table for authentication attempts, a table for company access logs and a table for support tickets. Each table displayed specific data and had the option to be dynamically filtered. In addition, the support ticket table had to be merged with the support ticket team to display the support ticket summary when clicked. I used React and Redux to build the client side component of this page and I used Node.js with Hapi framework to build the server side. To display data on the client side, I wrote API endpoints and custom queries in MongoDB to retrieve aggregated data from the data store. 

**Inspiration**

  As a student trying to enroll into classes, I was inspired by UBC Slacknotes, which is a tool created to aid UBC students in automating the task of checking seat availability for high demand classes. I found this tool inspiring because it solved a relatively simple problem that was an unmet need for students. This simple tool reminded me of the magic of software engineering. By typing instructions onto a monitor, a person can create a tool or program and have thousands of people use and benefit from it. I love the idea of creating something that previously did not exist and I look forward to finding my own bugs to fix and solve as I progress in my software development career.

**Focus**

  I would love to challenge myself to take on a full-scale project that encompasses both client side and server side components. My goal is to become proficient in both front-end and back-end development and I want to be exposed to the entire picture of software development. This includes implementing, testing and deploying projects and understanding the professional standards and processes that industry leaders follow. I believe that diving straight into a full-scale project would be immensely rewarding and also introduce me to new technologies and greatly improve my technical abilities. Furthermore, I would love to take this opportunity to improve my design skills by learning from the best in the industry. I would love to learn and follow the thought process that goes into designing products, implementing designs and choosing the optimal user interface.
